# Inventory Management System (IMS)

## Overview
The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** is a software application designed to help manage inventory, track product information, and handle user logins. The system is structured with a user-friendly interface and seamless scene transitions between login and inventory management functionalities.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project was to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in the development of an inventory management system using **JavaFX**. The application follows OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create well-structured and maintainable code. JavaFX was chosen for its powerful features to build rich graphical user interfaces, allowing us to create an intuitive and visually appealing system for managing inventory.

To run the program in its entirety, execute the `InventoryLogin.java` file, which acts as the entry point to the application.

## How to Run the Program
To launch the program, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Java installed**: The program is written in Java, so make sure you have the correct version of Java installed on your system.
   - To check your Java version, run: `java -version` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Compile the Java files**:
   - In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your project files are located.
   - Compile all the necessary Java files by running the following command:
     ```bash
     javac *.java
     ```

3. **Run the application**:
   - Once the files are compiled, execute the main login file:
     ```bash
     java InventoryLogin
     ```

4. **Access the Inventory System**:
   - Upon running the program, the login screen will appear. Enter the necessary credentials to access the Inventory Management System.

## Credits
The following team members contributed to the development of the **Inventory Management System (IMS)**:

- **Leader: Laura Estremera**
  - Responsible for coding and structuring the core objects used in the Inventory Management System. This includes designing classes to handle product information, inventory tracking, and database interactions.
  
- **Lead GUI: Omari Harvey**
  - Developed and implemented the **Inventory Management GUI** and its associated controller. Omari's work ensures that users can interact with the inventory system effectively, navigating through different sections of the application.

- **Nex Humphrey**
  - Created the **Login Controller** and integrated the login functionality with the inventory management GUI. Nex also combined both graphical interfaces (Login GUI and Inventory Management GUI) to allow seamless transitions between scenes when the user logs in and accesses the inventory system.

- **Melissa Gomez**
  - Designed the **Login GUI** layout, focusing on creating a clean and intuitive interface for users to input their credentials. Melissa's design ensures a user-friendly and professional look for the login screen.

## Features
- **User Login**: Secure login system with access control based on user credentials.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, edit, and delete inventory items; track product details such as name, description, quantity, and price.
- **Scene Transitions**: Smooth transitions between the login screen and inventory management interface after successful login.
