This project aims to make a small-scale Inventory Management System for a grocery store using object-oriented programming (JavaScript). Laura Estremera worked collaboratively with three of her peers to program and make a GUI using Scene Builder and JavaFX.

Instructions:
To run the program in its entirety, use the InventoryLogin.java

Credits:
•	Leader: Laura Estremera – coded the objects used in the Inventory Management System
•	Lead GUI: Omari Harvey – built the Inventory Management GUI and controller.
•	Nex Humphrey – made the Login controller and combined both GUIs using IMS to switch between scenes
•	Melissa Gomez – designed the Login GUI.
