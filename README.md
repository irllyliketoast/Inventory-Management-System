# inventorymanagementsystem
I led this project in my Object-Oriented Programming class. This project aims to make a small-scale Inventory Management System for a grocery store while using object-oriented programming (using JavaScript). I worked collaboratively with four of my peers to not only program, but also to make a GUI using Scene Builder and JavaFX.
